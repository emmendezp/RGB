In mathematics (in particular, functional analysis), convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions (f and g) that produces a third function (f * g) that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other. The term convolution refers to both the result function and to the process of computing it. It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reflected about the y-axis and shifted. The choice of which function is reflected and shifted before the integral does not change the integral result (see commutativity). The integral is evaluated for all values of shift, producing the convolution function.

// this class describes the structure
// and movents of the brick
class Brick{
  constructor(bc, y){
    this.brickColor = bc;
    this.yPos = y;
    this.xPos = 0;
  }

  // this function creates the brick
  createBrick(){
    fill(this.brickColor);
    rect(this.xPos, this.yPos, 100, 50);
  }

  // this function sets the speed
  // of movement of the brick to 1
  setSpeed(){
    this.xSpeed = 1;
  }

  // this function set the bricks in motion
  moveBrick(){
    this.xPos+=this.xSpeed;
    if(this.xPos+100 >= width || this.xPos <= 0){
      this.xSpeed*=-1;
    }
  }
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(720, 400);
  createP("Keep the mouse clicked").style('color','#ffffff');
  createP("to check whether the bricks").style('color','#ffffff');
  createP("are moving at same speed or not").style('color','#ffffff');
}

// creating two bricks of
// colors white and black
let brick1 = new Brick("white",100);
let brick2 = new Brick("black",250);

//
brick1.setSpeed();
brick2.setSpeed();

function draw () {
  background(0);
  if(mouseIsPressed){
    background(50);
  }
  brick1.createBrick();
  brick1.moveBrick();
  if(!mouseIsPressed){
    createBars();
  }
  brick2.createBrick();
  brick2.moveBrick();
}

// this function creates the black and
// white bars across the screen
function createBars() {
  let len = 12;
  for(let i = 0;i<width/len;i++){
    fill("white");
    if(i%2 == 0)
    rect(i*len,height,len,-height);
  }
}

## Image Kernel
In image processing, a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a small matrix used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between the kernel and an image.
### Convolution : 
Convolution is the process of adding each element of the image to its local neighbors, weighted by the kernel. This is related to a form of mathematical convolution. The matrix operation being performed—convolution—is not traditional matrix multiplication, despite being similarly denoted by *.

For example, if we have two three-by-three matrices, the first a kernel, and the second an image piece, convolution is the process of flipping both the rows and columns of the kernel and multiplying locally similar entries and summing. The element at coordinates [2, 2] (that is, the central element) of the resulting image would be a weighted combination of all the entries of the image matrix, with weights given by the kernel:

### Example

{{< p5-global-iframe id="breath" width="700" height="450" >}}

let kernel = [[-1, -1, -1 ], [ -1,  9, -1 ], [-1, -1, -1 ]]; 

// preload() runs once, before setup()
// loadImage() needs to occur here instead of setup()
// if loadImage() is called in setup(), the image won't appear 
// since noLoop() restricts draw() to execute only once
// (one execution of draw() is not enough time for the image to load),
// preload() makes sure image is loaded before anything else occurs
function preload() {
  // load the original image
  img = loadImage("assets/rover.png"); 
}

// setup() runs after preload, once()
function setup() {
  // create canvas
  createCanvas(710, 400);
  // noLoop() makes draw() run only once, not in a loop
  noLoop();
}

// draw() runs after setup(), normally on a loop
// in this case it runs only once, because of noDraw()
function draw() {
  
  // place the original image on the upper left corner
  image(img, 0, 0);

  // create a new image, same dimensions as img
  edgeImg = createImage(img.width, img.height);
  
  // load its pixels
  edgeImg.loadPixels();

  
  // two for() loops, to iterate in x axis and y axis
  // since the kernel assumes that the pixel
  // has pixels above, under, left, and right
  // we need to skip the first and last column and row
  // x then goes from 1 to width - 1
  // y then goes from 1 to height - 1

  for (let x = 1; x < img.width - 1; x++) {
    for (let y = 1; y < img.height - 1; y++) {
      // kernel sum for the current pixel starts as 0
      let sum = 0; 
      
      // kx, ky variables for iterating over the kernel
      // kx, ky have three different values: -1, 0, 1
      for (kx = -1; kx <= 1; kx++) {
        for (ky = -1; ky <= 1; ky++) {
          
          let xpos = x + kx;
          let ypos = y + ky;
          let pos = (y + ky)*img.width + (x + kx);
          // since our image is grayscale, 
          // RGB values are identical
          // we retrieve the red value for this example
          let val = red(img.get(xpos, ypos));
          // accumulate the  kernel sum
          // kernel is a 3x3 matrix
          // kx and ky have values -1, 0, 1
          // if we add 1 to kx and ky, we get 0, 1, 2
          // with that we can use it to iterate over kernel
          // and calculate the accumulated sum
          sum += kernel[ky+1][kx+1] * val;
        }
      }
      
      // set the pixel value of the edgeImg 
      edgeImg.set(x, y, color(sum, sum, sum));
    }
  }
  
  // updatePixels() to write the changes on edgeImg
  edgeImg.updatePixels();
  
  // draw edgeImg at the right of the original image
  image(edgeImg, img.width, 0);
}
